1) Which country imposed the most tariffs on "Automobiles"?

SELECT c.country_name, COUNT(*) AS num_tariffs

JOIN Goods g ON t.goods_id = g.goods_id
JOIN Country c ON te.source_country_id = c.country_id
WHERE g.goods_name = 'Automobiles'
GROUP BY c.country_name
ORDER BY num_tariffs DESC
LIMIT 1;

2)  Find the maximum tariff rate imposed on "All Chinese goods" by the United States across all events ?

SELECT MAX(t.rate) AS max_tariff_rate
FROM Tariff t
JOIN TariffEvent te ON t.event_id = te.event_id

WHERE g.goods_name = 'All Chinese goods'
  AND te.source_country_id = 1  -- United States;

3) How many distinct goods had tariffs imposed by China on the United States as of April 9, 2025?

FROM Tariff t
JOIN TariffEvent te ON t.event_id = te.event_id
JOIN Goods g ON t.goods_id = g.goods_id
WHERE te.source_country_id = 2  -- China

  AND t.effective_date <= '2025-04-09';

4) Find the list of events where the tariff rate was 25% or higher ?

SELECT te.event_date, te.description, g.goods_name, t.rate
FROM Tariff t
JOIN TariffEvent te ON t.event_id = te.event_id
JOIN Goods g ON t.goods_id = g.goods_id
WHERE t.rate >= 25.00;


5) Find the average tariff rate imposed per month ?
